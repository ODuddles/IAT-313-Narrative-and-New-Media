Boxy: I'm gonna go. Can you come with me?
Squishy: Wait. Why do you wanna leave? It's nice here. 
Boxy: Look - I don't want to just be some stupid container that barely gets used. I just lost my lid so Grandma's gonna throw me away and I don't see a point in staying here. 
Squishy: Hey Hey Hey. Calm down. Relax. You really wanna leave? It's really not that bad, y'know, we get to hang out with Eli and all.
Boxy: Ugh. I just wanna see what's out there. I wanna become something else. 
Boxy: Just follow me.
